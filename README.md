Weather Aggregator: Your Go-To Weather & News Companion
1. What and Why?

**Project Overview:**
Weather Aggregator is a mobile web application that provides real-time weather updates and localized news for 
specific regions. It consolidates weather forecasts, severe weather alerts, and relevant local news into one intuitive
platform.

**Problem & Importance:**
Many existing weather apps focus solely on temperature and forecasts but lack an integrated approach to regional 
weather impact and news. Users often have to switch between multiple apps to get weather updates and stay informed 
about weather-related news. Weather Aggregator bridges this gap by combining these features into a single platform, 
ensuring users are well-prepared and informed.

**2. For Whom?**

**Target Users:**
* **Commuters & Travelers:** Need accurate forecasts and alerts to plan their routes.
* **Outdoor Enthusiasts:** Hikers, bikers, and campers who require precise weather conditions.
* **Local Businesses:** Restaurants, event organizers, and farmers who rely on weather updates.
* **General Public:** Anyone who wants easy access to weather forecasts and related news.

By targeting these real and diverse groups, our application ensures usability and impact.

**3. How?**

**Key Features:**

* Real-time Weather Updates – Provides temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecasts.
* Localized News Integration – Displays weather-related news, emergency alerts, and climate reports.
* Severe Weather Alerts – Sends push notifications for storms, floods, and extreme weather conditions.
* Customizable Locations – Users can set preferred regions to receive updates specific to their area.
* Minimalist & Mobile-Friendly Design – Ensures a seamless experience across devices.

Users will be able to view their local weather and news in one dashboard, eliminating the need for multiple applications.

**4. Scope**

**Feasibility**:

The project is designed to be challenging yet achievable within a semester for a team of 2-3 programmers. It involves:

* Front-End Development (React/Next.js, Bootstrap/Tailwind for UI)
* Back-End Development (Node.js/Express, Firebase, or AWS for data storage)
* APIs (Weather API like OpenWeatherMap & News API for real-time data)

We will ensure that our scope remains realistic by starting with core features and iterating based on user feedback.
